2004, the year that I ceased to be a full time developer. From that point on, I was no longer a developer by profession. Not full-time, not part-time, not moonlight. 

## My Background

I do have a technical background. I have a MSCS degree from way back when, and have spent the first 6-7 years of my career performing security audits and penetration tests, and building one of the world's largest managed security services (at least at the time).

My programming langauge progression, when I was technical, has been BASIC (high school), Pascal and C (college), Perl, PHP, Java, and Javascript (during my technical career). I can't claim to be an "expert" in any of these languages, but I consider myself quite proficient in each at the time I was using them.

I was also reasonably network and system savvy, in the sense that I can get myself in and around the Solaris and Linux (UN*X) systems pretty well, and understand the networking stack sufficiently. I consider myself fairly proficient with the various system commands and tools.

For the past 12 years, however, I have not been a developer, nor a systems guy, nor a networking guy. Instead, I have been running product management for various startups and large companies in the security and infrastructure space. 

Since the career change, I've not done any meaningful code development. I've written a script here and there, but nothing that I would consider to be "software." However, I've managed engineering teams as part of my resonsibility, in addition to product management, to produce large scale software. 

In the past 12 years, my most used IDE is called Microsoft Office. So, in short, I am probably semi-technical, and know just enough to be dangerous.
